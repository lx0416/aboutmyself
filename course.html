            <p>The final year project consists of extensive research on the various architectures used in Deep Learning.
                The project is currently ongoing but a prototype has been developed, and can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/lx0416/FYP-Facial-Expression-Recognition/blob/main/Week%2010%20submission.ipynb" target="_blank " class="about-button "> here </a>.  
                The prototype consists of a comparison between a fully connected feedforward neural network and a convolutional neural network (CNN). 
                Since background research suggests that a more complex and deep neural network performs better, it is expected that CNN will triumph.
                The dataset was acquired via <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013" target="_blank " class="about-button "> Kaggle </a>.
                <br><br>The remaining work intends to employ data augmentation and transfer learning to CNN.

                The creatures have a chance of mutation which might change the genetic material of the creatures so that overtime new variation comes and is tested and the population as a whole changes over time.

                The data was sufficiently cleaned using methods such as tokenization and lemmatization.
                <br><br>Text representation methods such as Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF were applied to generate a baseline model and a classification approach respectively.
                Baseline model utilises Multinomial Naive Bayes, which generated a 94% accuracy, while the classification approach utilises Random Forest, with a 98% accuracy.

            <p>This project arose to be integrated as an airport virtual assistant. 
                It will be installed in an environment that can be extremely noisy, so, the ASR system is configured to handle this situation by implementing a moving average low-pass filter to handle noisy environments.                
                <br><br>The project incorporates ASR software packages in the application to avoid slow-down or interruptions to the system in the event of issues with the internet connection. 
                It utilizes offline ASR such as Mozilla DeepSpeech, Google Speech Recognition and Vosk.
                <br><br>User selects any of three languages and audio files are provided to evaluate the application.
                The performance of using the three different software are then compared by their Word Error Rate (WER).

            <p>A project that researches on Champion, Damage, and Equipment in the League of Legends Esports Scene.
                The research questions are as follows:
                <li style="transform: translate(50%, 0%);">Which champion deals the most attack damage? </li>
                <li style="transform: translate(50%, 0%);">Which champion deals the most magic damage?</li>
                <li style="transform: translate(50%, 0%);">Which champion is relatively easy to master?</li>
                <li style="transform: translate(50%, 0%);">What type of equipment is suitable for some champions?</li>
                <br><br><br><br>
                <p>The project was completed in a Jupyter notebook and the dataset was acquired via <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/tekpixo/leagueoflegendsprematch2021?select=dataset_champions.csv" target="_blank " class="about-button "> Kaggle </a>. 
                The data was sufficiently cleaned and analysed to answer the research questions above. An interesting insight is that there are more champions that are difficult to master, which makes LoL a relatively difficult game for new moba players. 
                Another interesting point to note is that surprisingly, the champion with the highest damage is a tank/fighter, rather than a mage/marksman.
