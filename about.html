            <br>
            <p>A booking system specifically created to allow SIM students to book study tables along the corridor. The project was completed as a group of 6.

            <br><br><br>
            <p>A trading simulator that simulates cryptocurrency trading on platforms such as moomoo. The terminal is used to display the user's current wallet as well as state the currency and amount they would like to bid or ask for.
